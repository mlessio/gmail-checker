# Gmail Checker
A simple library that checks if a Google Gmail account is already taken.
It may be suitable for email check, or other stuff.

## Installation

Download or clone this repo or install through npm:

```javascript
npm install --save gmail-checker
```

## Usage
```javascript
var GmailChecker = require('gmail-checker');

console.log(GmailChecker);
```

### Promise based
If the check is invoked without a callback object, a Promise is returned immediately.

You can use it like this:
```javascript
GmailChecker.check('myDesiredUsername').then(function(result){
  //check executed
  //do stuff with the result data
  if(result.exists){
    console.log('Gmail username already taken...');
  }else{
    console.log('Gmail username is available!');
  }
}).catch(function(err){
  //do something with the error data
  console.error(err);
});
```

### Callback based

If the check is invoked with a callback function, it'll be invoked after the check has been executed.

You can use it like this:
```javascript
GmailChecker.check('myDesiredUsername', function(err, result){

  //first argument, if not null is the error
  if(err){
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  //check executed
  //do stuff with the result data
  if(result.exists){
    console.log('Gmail username already taken...');
  }else{
    console.log('Gmail username is available!');
  }
});
```

### Localization
You can set the request locale in order to receive localized error messages from Google.
You can do something like:
```javascript
GmailChecker.setLocale('en');
```
before performing a request.
